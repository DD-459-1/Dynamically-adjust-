# Dynamically-adjust-
The code in this project demonstrates the performance of the Adam, Yogi, and AdaBelief optimizers with and without the DA/DAs strategies in long-term time series forecasting models.

The time series prediction model implementation is adapted from the repository at https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library. 

Experimental parameters can be configured in the run.py file, and training can be initiated by simply executing run.py.

# Usage
1. Install Python 3.12 For convenience. execute the following command.

 ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the well pre-processed datasets from [Google Drive]() or [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17g_HBZzJ-e_WRTpx7-6qlQ?pwd=3nvc). Then place the downloaded data in the folder `./dataset`
